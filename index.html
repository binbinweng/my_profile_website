            <h3>Edge Computing</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Applied an energy efficient scheduling method using HEFT and DUPRS algorithms, which extends the scheduling length slightly to save energy, to a hierarchical orchestration framework, which is better suited for geo-distributed edge computing environment than the state-of-the-art.</li>
              <li>Deployed and tested the framework across clusters of Raspberry Piâ€™s located in diverse geographical regions.</li>
              <li>Tested and compared the performance of DAG applications, orchestrated using Docker containers and deployment descriptors, on the new framework against the industry-standard K3S platform.</li>
              <li>Results indicated a noteworthy reduction in energy consumption ranging from 14% to 43% compared to K3S, while maintaining scheduling lengths within a margin of 2% to 9% longer. This efficiency enhancement presents an attrac-tive tradeoff for edge computing scenarios.</li>

            <h3>Disease Inference on Clinical Healthcare Text Data</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Extracted symptoms from clinical text data with the techniques of MetaMap and NLTK.</li>
              <li>Represented symptoms using TF-IDF and Word2Vec methods. </li>
              <li>Built a multi-label classifier for disease inference using BiGRU and BiLSTM with the two representations using PyTorch, achieving an AUC of 0.856, which is much higher than that of BiLSTM with the word sequence (0.743).</li>

              <li>Deployed two classification models (free and premium), by creating containers with AWS EKS with load balancing, which ensures that at least 3 containers will be working for the premium model when the workload is high. </li>

          Binbin was a very good student in school. 
          She was curious about some technical details and eager to ask questions when she took my course.
          In addition, she never hesitated to share her thinking and ideas with me and her classmates.
